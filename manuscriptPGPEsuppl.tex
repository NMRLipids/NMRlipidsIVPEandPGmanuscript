\section{Evaluation of simulations against NMR experiments}
\subsection{Conformational ensembles of headgroup and glycerol backbone in PE and PG lipids}

The quality of PE and PG headgroup conformational ensembles in different simulations against NMR experiments is evaluated in figures \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG} using C-H bond order parameters as in our previous studies for PC and PS lipids \cite{botan15,antila19}. Conclusions are the same for all lipids: None of the force fields correctly captures the lipid headgroup conformational ensembles, but CHARMM36 gives results closest to experiments. Most importantly for this work, the CHARMM36 captures the distinct headgroup order parameters for PG and PS lipids observed in NMR experiments (Figs. \ref{HGorderParameters} and \ref{structures} in the main text). 

It should be noted that the PG headgroup is biologically abundant R enantiomer in all simulations, while our $^{13}$C NMR experiments has a racemic mixture. Nevertheless, previous $^{2}$H NMR experiments comparing results between different enantiomers concluded that the structural differences between these are minor \cite{wohlgemuth80}.

%The poor performance of headgroup order parameters in Berger model can be probably explained by
%ring like structures seen in Fig. 6 in Ref. \citenum{mukhopadhyay04}, which is a typical feature
%for Berger based lipid force fields containing explicit hydrogen atoms in the head group \cite{zhao08,henin09,dahlberg10}.
%The poor performance of glycerol backbone of Slipids simulations is systemically observed also
%for other lipids in previous studies \cite{botan15,antila19}.

    Signs are determined as discussed in Refs. \citenum{botan15,ollila16}.
  }
\end{figure*}

Headgroup order parameters of PC lipids are unchanged upon addition
of zwitterionic lipids or cholesterol in experiments, but increase
upon addition of negatively charged PG or PS lipids because
headgroup dipole tilts more parallel to the membrane plane after incorporation
of negative charges into the membrane~\cite{seelig87, scherer87,antila18}.
The response of PC headgroup order parameters to the addition of PE or PG lipids
from different simulations is compared with experiments in figure~\ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPG}.
None of the simulations reproduce neither the experimentally observed increase in PC headgroup order parameters
with increasing amount of PG nor the related tilting of the headgroup more parallel with the membrane.
Similar observations in our previous work for PS lipids were explained by the overestimated counterion
binding affinity that neutralizes the effect of added negative charge \cite{antila19}.
All simulations except Berger-OPLS predict tilting of P-N headgroup outwards from the membrane and
decrease of PC headgroup order parameters upon addition of PE lipids.
These results are not in line with experiments where the PC headgroup order parameters are not affected by zwitterionic lipids \cite{scherer87}.
The good performance of Berger-OPLS simulations is surprising here because
headgroup conformational ensemble is not very close to experiments in this model and
the response of headgroup order parameters
to cholesterol was significantly overestimated by the Berger/H{\"o}ltje force field in our previous work \cite{botan15}.

In conclusion, more accurate force fields are needed to correctly simulate the interactions between different headgroups.

\subsection{PG headgroup in mixtures with PC lipids}
Changes in other than PC lipid headgroup with changing membrane composition are less
extensively characterized in the literature.
The $\beta$-carbon order parameter in PG headgroup increases
mildly \cite{macdonald87} or is unchanged~\cite{borle85} upon increasing amount
of PC lipids (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPGvsPCchange}), but experimental data from
$\alpha$-carbon is not available. Also the tested force fields predict very small changes
for the $\beta$-carbon order parameter, while the P-N vector tilt and its response to the
increased amount of PC varies significantly between force fields in figure \ref{HGorderparametersPGvsPCchange}. 
Therefore, more experimental data and more accurate force fields are still required
to resolve the PG conformational ensembles in mixtures with other lipids.

\subsection{Calcium binding to POPC:POPG mixtures}

The changes of headgroup order parameters in POPC:POPG mixtures upon addition of CaCl$_2$ between different simulations
and experiments \cite{borle85,macdonald87} are compared in figures \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} (molar ratio 1:1) and \ref{changesWITHCaClPG1PC4} (molar ratio 4:1).
The results are in line with our previous studies:
most force fields overestimate the calcium binding \cite{catte16,antila19}, but CHARMM36 with the NBfix correction underestimates the binding affinity \cite{antila19}, and the implicit inclusion of electronic polarizability using the electronic continuum correction (ECC) improves the results \cite{melcr18,melcr20}.

\section{Simulated systems}

The simulated systems of pure PE and PG bilayers without additional ions
are listed in Tables~\ref{systemsPE} and \ref{systemsPG},
and lipid mixtures with additional ions in Tables~\ref{systemsMIX} and \ref{systemsMIX2}.
The simulations were analyzed using preliminary versions of the NMRlipids databank
(\url{www.nmrlipids.fi}, \url{github.com/NMRlipids/MATCH} and \url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/NMRlipidsIVPEandPG/tree/master/Data/Simulations})
and unique naming convention for lipid atoms (\url{http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/2015/03/mapping-scheme-for-lipid-atom-names-for.html}),
which enable automatic analysis of simulations with different force fields with varying atom naming conventions.
The automatic analyses were implemented using MDAnalysis \cite{agrawal11,gowers16} and MDTraj \cite{mcgibbon15}
python libraries, and tools in the GROMACS sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.
All codes are available from the project's GitHub repository \cite{NMRlipidsIVbgit}.

The C--H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the carbon and hydrogen positions using the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\left\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \right\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal
(taken to align with $z$, with bilayer periodicity in the $xy$-plane).
Angular brackets denote average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
Code for all atom simulations is available in Ref.~\citenum{MATCHgit} (\texttt{scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}).
For united atom simulations, we first constructed trajectories including hydrogens with ideal geometry using either \texttt{buildH} program~\cite{buildH} or (\texttt{scratch/opAAUA\_prod.py}) in  Ref.~\citenum{MATCHgit}, and the order parameters were then calculated from these trajectories. This approach has been tested against trajectories with explicit hydrogens and the deviations in order parameters are small \cite{buildH,piggot17}.\\
%\todo{BuildH program is now cited with a direct link to the GitHub repo. I think that a release to Zenodo would be nice in the final publication.}\\

\subsection{CHARMM36}

\noindent {\it POPE} A lipid bilayer, consisting of a total of 144 POPE molecules, distributed equally between the two leaflets was set using CHARMM-GUI \cite{lee2016charmm}. The bilayer was solvated by 5760 water molecules (40 per lipid). The random initial configuration and topologies were generated using the CHARMM-GUI web portal, which provides  GROMACS-compatible simulation input files \cite{lee16}. CHARMM36 lipid parameters \cite{klauda10} were used for POPE, whereas the CHARMM-specific TIP3P water model \cite{jorgensen1983comparison} was used for water. The bilayer was simulated for 500~ns using GROMACS 2018.6 at 310~K.

The recommended simulation parameters for CHARMM36 force field in GROMACS were used \cite{lee16}. Namely, buffered Verlet lists were used to keep track of neighbouring atoms \cite{Pall13}. The Lennard-Jones potential was cut off at 1.2~nm with the forces switched to 0 between 1.0~nm and the cutoff value. The smooth PME algorithm \cite{darden93,essman95} was used to account for long-range electrostatics. The temperatures of the lipid and the solvent were separately coupled to a Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat \cite{nose84,hoover85} with a time constant of 1~ps and a target temperature of 310~K. The system was coupled to a semi-isotropic (isotropic on the membrane plane) Parrinello--Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 5~ps, a reference pressure of 1~bar, and compressibility of 4.5$\times$10$^{-5}$~1/bar. The bonds with hydrogen atoms were constrained using p-LINCS \cite{hess07,hess97}.

The simulation files are available at Ref.~\citenum{charmm36POPEfiles}.

with 288 DPPE lipids and 9386 water molecules
was constructed with the MEMBRANE BUILDER website~\cite{ghahremanpour13}. The TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water model was used to solvate the system.
Simulation was performed for 200~ns, and the last 100~ns were used for the analysis. Simulation was carried out within the NPT ensemble using the GROMACS 5.0.4 package~\cite{abraham2015gromacs}. Timestep of 2~fs was used with the leapfrog integrator. The Nos\'{e}--Hoover thermostat~\cite{nose84,hoover85} was used with reference temperature of 336~K and a relaxation time constant of 0.5~ps; lipids and water were coupled separately to the heat bath. Pressure was kept constant at 1.013~bar using a semi--isotropic Parrinello--Rahman
barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 10.0~ps. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME method~\cite{darden93,essman95}. A real space cut-off of 1.0~nm was employed with grid spacing of 0.12~nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off at 1.4~nm, with a dispersion correction applied to both energy and pressure. All covalent bonds in lipids were constrained using the LINCS algorithm~\cite{hess97}, whereas water molecules were constrained using SETTLE~\cite{miyamoto92}. Twin-range cutoffs, 1.0~nm and 1.6~nm, were used for the neighbor lists with the long-range neighbor list updated every 10 steps.

For the 314~K temperature, simulation was performed for 200~ns, and the last 100~ns were used for the analysis. Same simulation conditions as DPPE for both temperatures.

\noindent{\it POPC:POPE mixture}
A POPC/POPE bilayer with its lipids distributed evenly among the leaflets was generated by from a pure POPC bilayer by removing and renaming atoms in the head group region. The bilayer contained a total of 100 POPC and 100 POPE lipids, and it was solvated by 45 water molecules per lipid (for a total of 9000 water molecules).

The Slipids force field \cite{jambeck12,jambeck12b,jambeck13} was used for lipids, and the TIP3P model \cite{jorgensen1983comparison} for water. A 300~ns-long simulation was performed using GROMACS 2019.4 \cite{abraham2015gromacs}. The simulation parameters were equal to those used for the POPC/POPG mixture with additional CaCl$_2$ (see below).

\noindent {\it POPC:POPG mixture with additional CaCl$_2$} 
A lipid bilayer consisting of a total of 256 lipids (128 POPC + 128 POPG) spread equally between the two leaflets was generated using CHARMM-GUI \cite{lee16}. The membrane was solvated by 50 water molecules per lipid (a total of 12800), and 128 Na$^{+}$ counter ions for the POPG charges. The initial random configuration was equilibrated using the CHARMM-GUI protocol and using the CHARMM36 force field \cite{klauda10}. Next, additional ions were added to obtain initial CaCl$_2$ concentrations of 0, 100, 200, 500, or 1000~mM (0/0, 23/46, 46/92, 115/230, 230/460 Ca$^{2+}$/Cl$^{-}$ ions) The systems were energy-minimized and equilibrated using the Slipids force field \cite{jambeck12,jambeck12b,jambeck13} before production simulations at 298~K. The ion parameters by \citeauthor{dang06} were used \cite{dang06}.

The neighbour lists with a cutoff of 1.0~nm were updated every 10 simulation steps. The smooth PME algorithm was used to calculate long-range electrostatics \cite{darden93,essman95}. The Lennard-Jones potential was cut off at 1.0~nm, and the dispersion corrections \cite{shirts07} were applied to energy and pressure. The stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat \cite{bussi07} with a time constant of 0.5~ps and a target temperature of 298~K was applied separately to lipids and the solvent. A constant pressure of 1~bar was maintained by a Parrinello--Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 10~ps and compressibility of 4.5$\times$10$^{-5}$~1/bar. The pressure coupling was performed semi-isotropically with the two simulation box vectors aligned along the membrane plane considered isotropic. All bonds were constrained using the p-LINCS algorithm \cite{hess97,hess07}.

The systems simulated for 1500~ns (CaCl$_2$-containing systems) or 500~ns (systems without CaCl$_2$). The simulations were performed using GROMACS 2019.4 \cite{abraham2015gromacs}, and the simulation files are available at Ref.~\citenum{slipidPOPC50POPG50T298K}.

\subsection{Berger}

Following the earlier convention in the NMRlipids Project~\cite{botan15}, 
for the Berger-based models we use the following naming convention: 
Berger - \{{\it molecule name}\} - \{{\it year when model published first time}\} \{{\it citation}\}.
%The reason is that there are several different molecular topologies which are using the non-bonded parameters originally
%developed by Berger et al.~\cite{berger97}. Thus the common factor in the Berger based models are the non-bonded parameters,
%while the molecule specific parameters might somewhat vary. However, the majority of the molecular level topologies are 
%relying (especially for the glycerol backbone and headgroup) on the parameters originally introduced by Marrink et al.~\cite{marrink98}.

Two systems were simulated using the Berger force field [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78845-3], pure POPC and a mixture 50:50 POPC:POPE. For POPE, we additionnally used the de Vries modification implementing a repulsion of the hydrogen atoms located on the amino group of ethanolamine [https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0366926].
Starting from a PDB file of a pure POPC system with Berger atom names, a 50:50 POPC:POPE mixture was built by mutating randomly methyl groups to hydrogens (POPC -> POPE). Each system contained 256 lipids (for the mixture 64 lipids per leaflet for each species) and about 40 water molecules per lipid. No ions were added. Both systems were minimized and equilibrated. The production simulations were run for 300 ns with a time step of 2 fs. The first 100 ns were discarded for the analysis (@Samuli: this sentence may be removed if the analysis was done on a different time window). The simulations were run with GROMACS 4.5.3 [https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt055] version. The v-rescale thermostat [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2408420] was used with a temperature of 300 K and a time constant of 0.1 ps; lipids and water were coupled separately to the heat bath. Pressure was kept constant at 1 bar using a semi–isotropic Parrinello–Rahman barostat [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1196] with a time constant of 4.0 ps. A real space cut-off of 1.0 nm was employed for van der Waals and electrostatic interactions.

\noindent {\it POPE} 

A bilayer patch with a total of 144 POPE molecules, distributed evenly between two leaflets, was created by reordering atoms in a final structure of a POPE simulation performed using the CHARMM36 force field. The bilayer was hydrated by 40 water molecules per lipid for a total of 5760 water molecules. The OPLS-based MacRog force field was used \cite{Kulig15b} for lipids and the TIP3P model \cite{jorgensen1983comparison} for water. 

Buffered Verlet lists \cite{Pall13} were used to keep track of neighbours. The Lennard-Jones potential was cut off at 1.0~nm, and dispersion corrections were applied to energy and pressure \cite{shirts07}. Smooth PME algorithm was used to calculate long-range electrostatics \cite{darden93,essman95}. The Nos\'{e}--Hoover thermostat was used to keep the temperatures of the lipids and water at 310~K. These groups were coupled separately, and a time constat of 0.4~ps was used. The Parrinello--Rahman barostat was used to keep the pressures in the membrane plane as well as normal to it constant at 1~bar. For the barostat, a time constant of 10~ps was used, and the membrane compressibility was set to 4.5$\times$10$^{-5}$~1/bar. All bonds were constrained using p-LINCS \cite{hess97,hess07}.

The system was simulated for 500~ns using GROMACS 2019.2 \cite{abraham2015gromacs}, and the simulation data are available at Ref.~\citenum{MacRogPOPEfiles}.


\noindent {\it POPC:POPE mixtures} 

Force field details
Simulations of POPC:POPE mixtures using the OPLS-MacRog force field [https://doi.org/10.1021/jp5016627] were performed. 
The initial force field parameter files in GROMACS format were taken from ref [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2016.03.067]. 
However, a number of errors were detected in the published files so we fixed them in the following way. 
For POPE, the two aliphatic chains sn-1 and sn-2 were switched (in the file the lipid was in fact OPPE); 
one atom (named C27) was not connected to the previous atom in the aliphatic chain so bonds, angles, dihedrals, 
pairs were included to create the connection; two atoms were called C27 thus one of them was renamed C28. 
For POPC, some impropers were missing leading to non planar systems for double bonds 
(in particular the carbonyls of sn-1 and sn-2 as well as the double bond of the oleoyl chain), 
we thus added back those impropers. The resulting fixed files can be found on 
Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3741793/files/popc\_fixed.itp, https://zenodo.org/record/3725637/files/pope\_fixed.itp). 
To check our fix, one simulation of pure POPC was also run and the order parameter compared to previous published results 
of ref [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b04878]. We found very similar values.
All the details of the procedure described here are described 
in https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/~fuchs/project\_Samuli/POPC\_POPE/report\_results\_comparison.pdf.

The data for pure POPC are available from [https://zenodo.org/record/3741793], for the POPC:POPE mixture from [https://zenodo.org/record/3725637].

Simulation details
Two systems of pure POPC and 50:50 POPC:POPE mixture were built using CHARMM-GUI [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00935]. They contained 128 lipids and 5120 TIP3 water molecules. The initial PDB file was modified to match OPLS-MacRog nomenclature and atom order. No ions were added. The production simulations were run for 500 ns with a time step of 2 fs. The first 200 ns were discarded for the analysis (@Samuli: this sentence may be removed if the analysis was done on a different time window). The simulations were run withthe GROMACS 2018.5 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2015.06.001] version. The v-rescale thermostat [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2408420] was used with a temperature of 300 K and a time constant of 0.1 ps; lipids and water were coupled separately to the heat bath. Pressure was kept constant at 1 bar using a semi–isotropic Parrinello–Rahman barostat [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1196] with a time constant of 4.0 ps. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME method [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.464397, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.470117]. A real space cut-off of 1.0 nm was employed with a grid spacing of 0.1 nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off at 1.0 nm. All covalent bonds in lipids were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-987X(199709)18:12%3C1463::AID-JCC4%3E3.0.CO;2-H]. Water molecules were kept rigid with the SETTLE algorithm [https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.540130805]. The simulation files are available from ref 66 [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3741793] (pure POPC) and 67 [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3725637] (POPC:POPE mixture).

Initial structures were build by removing appropriate amount of lipids from POPC:POPG 7:3 mixture available from Ref.~\citenum{POPCPOPG73lipid17}.
Force field parameters from the same reference were used \todo{We still need description from A. Peon how these were obtained},
except that incorrect dihedrals with type 1 were changed to type 9
(for details, see discussion in \url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/NMRlipidsIVPEandPG/issues/12}).
Simulations were performed using the Gromacs simulation package~\cite{pall20} with the time step of 2~fs. 
The non-bonded interactions were calculated directly within 1.0~nm cutoff; the Verlet scheme was used\cite{Pall13};
and the long-range electrostatic forces were calculated using particle mesh Ewald~\cite{essman95}. 
The bond lengths of hydrogen atoms were constrained using LINCS~\cite{hess97}.
Temperature was coupled to the velocity rescaling thermostat \cite{bussi07} at 298~K with a coupling constant of 1~ps.
Pressure was coupled to the Parrinello--Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81} at 1~bar with a coupling constant of 10~ps. 
For simulations with CaCl$_2$, appropriate amount of ions with Dang~\cite{smith94,dang06} parameters were added into the solvent.
The simulation files are available from

\subsection{Lipid17ecc}
\noindent {\it POPC:POPG 4:1 and POPC:POPG 1:1 mixtures with different CaCl$_2$ concentrations}
Implicit inclusion of electronic polarizability by electronic continuum correction (ECC),
implemented by scaling the partial charges in force fields, can be used to improve ion interactions with lipids
and other biomolecules in classical MD simulations~\cite{dijon20}.
For Amber Lipid14/17 force fields, ECC has been previously implemented by scaling the
charges and Lennard-Jones~$\sigma$s of headgroup, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions
by constant factors~\cite{melcr18,melcr20}.
Here, we apply similar ECC approach to Amber Lipid17 PG parameters as done previously for PS \cite{melcr20}:
charges and Lennard-Jones $\sigma$s of headgroup, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions
of parameters POPG from Ref.~\citenum{POPCPOPG73lipid17} were scaled by factors of $f_q$=0.75 and $f_\sigma$=0.89, respectively
(and the dihedral types were corrected to type 9 as in previous section).
Previously introduced ECC-POPC parameters (scaling factors $f_q$=0.8 and $f_\sigma$=0.89 applied to Lipid14 POPC parameters)
were used for POPC~\cite{melcr18}.
ECC-ion parameters with the scaled charges \cite{pluharova14,kohagen16,martinek18}
from \url{bitbucket.org/hseara/ions/src/master/}, and SPC/E water model~\cite{berendsen87} were used in these simulations. 
Rest of the simulation parameters and initial configurations were taken from Lipid17
simulations~\cite{Lipid17POPCPOPG8020,Lipid17POPCPOPG8020100mMCaCl,Lipid17POPCPOPG80201000mMCaCl,Lipid17POPCPOPG5050,Lipid17POPCPOPG5050100mMCaCl,Lipid17POPCPOPG50501000mMCaCl}.
