\section{Introduction}

In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
Here we extend the same goal for other than PC lipids.
Currently the focus is on PE, PG and PS bilayers and their
mixtures with PC. Experimental data with different amounts of 
added salt is now collected and presented in this manuscript.

%\end{figure}


Absolute values of experimental order parameters for different lipid headgroups are
collected in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. Signs are measured only for PC as far as I know,
thus only absolute values are used for now.

Based on superficial reading, the conclusions in the literature are roughly \\ 
1) glycerol backbone structures are largely similar irrespectively of the headroup \cite{gally81}, \\
2) glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}, \\
3) headgroup structures are similar in PC, PE and PG lipids, while headgroup is more rigid in PS lipids \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. \\
Extensive discussion about structural details of PE, PG or PS headgroups do not exists (as far as I know), 
In contrast to PC lipids (see \cite{botan15} and references therein).



Several simulations containing PE, PG and PS lipids have been published \cite{??}, \todo{List should be completed}
however, glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are not compared to
the experiments (based on superficial reading of literature).

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Experimental C--H bond order parameters}% from the natural abundance $^{13}$C\,NMR}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone C--H bond order parameter magnitudes and signs of POPE and POPG
were determined by measuring the chemical-shift resolved dipolar splittings
with a R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDLF) experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04} and
%The corresponding order parameter signs were measured with a
S-DROSS experiments~\cite{gross97} using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy
as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16,NMRlipidsIVps}.
%The experiments were done in a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a $^1$H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz.
%Magic angle spinning (MAS) of the sample was used at a frequency of 5.15 kHz (R-PDLF experiment) and 5 kHz (S-DROSS experiment).
%The following experimental setups were used.
\todo{The rest of the details to be written. I am not sure how much we need to repeat the NMRlipidsIVps paper.}

\section{Molecular dynamics simulations}

Molecular dynamics simulation data were collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}, with
the NMR\-lipids Project blog (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
GitHub repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems are listed in 
Table \ref{systems} (pure PE and PG bilayers without additional ions).
%and \ref{mixedIONsystems} (mixed PC:PS bilayers at various salt concentrations).
Further simulation details are given in the SI, and
the simulation data are indexed in a
searchable database available at \url{www.nmrlipids.fi},
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/MATCH}).

The C--H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the carbon and hydrogen positions using the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal
(taken to align with $z$, with bilayer periodicity in the $xy$-plane).
Angular brackets denote average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
Python program ({\tt scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}) that uses the
MDAnalysis library \cite{agrawal11,gowers16} is available in Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}. 
The ion number density profiles were calculated using the {\tt gmx density} tool
of the Gromacs sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of POPE and POPG from $^{13}$C NMR}

The glycerol backbone and $\alpha$-carbon peaks in INEPT spectra of POPE were assigned based on
previously measured POPC spectra (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}) \cite{ferreira13}. The $\beta$-carbon peak was assigned based
on $^{13}$C chemical shift table for amines available at \url{https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/nmr/c13-data/cdata.htm}.
The order parameters for the glycerol backbone and headgroup C--H bonds were determined
from 2D-RPDLF and S-DROSS experiments (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}), as described previously \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
The POPE experiments were recorded at 310~K, where the bilayer is in liquid disordered phase \cite{??}.
\todo{To be checked by Tiago}.

\todo{Figure and discussion about POPG experiments to be addded.}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of PE lipids are similar with 
different acyl chains and also close the values for POPC, althought PE gives systematically
slightly more positive values (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}). These could be explained with slightly larger temperature
in PE measurements, except for the $\alpha$-carbon with the positive sign, for which the
more positive value is farther away from zero. For PG lipids, the glycerol backbone order
parameters are more positive than for other lipids. The headgroup $\alpha$-carbon gives
value close to PE, while the value of $\beta$-carbon is distinct from other lipid being
only one which has positive sign, suggesting distinct conformation of PG lipids in this region.
This was not observed in previous $^2$H NMR study, where sign was not measured and $\beta$-carbon
order parameter was apparently similar to the value for PE and PC results.

In conclusion, the results suggests that the glycerol backbone conformations in all lipids are
relatively similar. Also, the headgroup conformations are similar for PC and PE lipids, while
PS and PG are singnificantly different. For PS lipids, the differences are discussed previously \cite{??}.

\subsection{PE headgroup and glycerol backbone}
%\todo{Add results from this discussion: \url{http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/2017/03/nmrlipids-iv-headgroup-glycerol.html?showComment=1502290977005#c4964787551006026647}}
Order parameters from Slipids simulations 
and experiments for DPPE are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPE}.
Glycerol backbone order parameters in Slipids are off from experiments,
as already observed previously for PC lipids \cite{botan15}.
Order parameter signs for PE are not experimentally measured yet.
For headgroup the signs are set to give best agreement with simulations
and for glycerol to be consistent with experimental signs for PC.
Order parameter for $\beta$ carbon shows apparent agreement
with experiments. However, the sign of beta order parameter is positive,
in contrast to PC where negative sign was measured. Thus, the the beta order
parameter agrees with experiment with the assumption that its sign is opposite
than for PC. This is yet to be confirmed by experiments.
Order parameter for $\alpha$ carbon is too close to zero, even if the sign
would be correct.

\todo{Berger results are not here yet, but we should mention the ring like structures
  pointed out by T. Piggot in the blog:
  The poor performance of headgroup order parameters in Berger model can be probably explained by ring like structures seen in Fig. 6 in Ref. \citenum{mukhopadhyay04}.
  These ring like structures are a widespread feature of typical Berger based lipid force fields containing explicit hydrogen atoms in the head group \cite{zhao08,henin09,dahlberg10}.

\subsection{PG headgroup and glycerol backbone}
Comparison between experiments and simulations for PG lipids is shown
in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}. The signs are not yet measured
experimentally. They are set to give the best argeement with experiments.
This would suggest that the $\beta$ order parameter would be positive,
in contrast to PC and PS headgroups, were negative signs were measured.
Even thought the signs turned out to be correct, the tested models would
not give a very good argeement with the experiments.

\subsection{Lipid headgroup interactions in PC:PE and PC:PG mixtures}
The headgroup 
order parameters increase with the addition of negatively charged PS and PG lipids,
decrease when mixed with positively charged surfactants and
are less affected by the addition of zwitterionic PE lipids or cholesterol.
In addition to the results summarized in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol},
also mixtures of PC with negatively charged PI, CL, PA, and zwitterionic SM
follow the eletrometer concept \cite{scherer87}.
to mixtures of differently charged
lipids are collected from different experiments in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}.
%\section{PC lipid headgroup response to different mixtures in experiments}
As shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}, order parameters of PC
headgroup behave in various lipid mixtures as expected from the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87, scherer87},
i.e., order parameters increase when anionic lipids are mixed with PC and decrease with cationic
surfactants. The changes with the addition of neutral lipids is significantly smaller.

%\end{figure}


The headgroup order parameters for PC lipids (POPC and DOPC)
mixed with PE, PS and PG lipids are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPG}
from different simulation model and experiments \cite{scherer87} with different
mole fractions. As already discussed previosly, the PC lipid headgroup behaviour
follows the electrometer concept in experiments when mixed with other lipids, i.e., the order
parameters increase when mixed with negatively charged lipids (PS, PI, CL, PA and PG)
remains almost unchaged when mixed with neutral lipids (PE and SM) \cite{scherer87}.
This is not the case in simulation data shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPG}.
The addition of DOPE into a POPC and DOPC bilayers significantly decreases the PC headgroup
order parameters in simulations with OPLS compatible version of the Berger force field \cite{tieleman06}
in contrast to experiments \cite{scherer87}. On the other hand, the increase of the PC
headgroup order parameters in CHARMM36 simulations mixed with PS and PG lipids is significantly
smaller than in experiments.

\todo{This is text by P. Fuchs, copied from the blog.}
Area results in nm$^2$, the error is <= 0.003 nm$^2$
- pure POPC
CHARMM36: 0.624
Berger : 0.649
- POPC/POPE 50:50
CHARMM36 : POPC 0.609, POPE 0.557
Berger-hacked: POPC 0.637, POPE 0.632
-----
One can see that CHARMM 36 predicts a drop in the area on going from pure POPC to POPC/POPE 50:50. This means that POPC pack tightly to POPE.
In contrast, the values for Berger are not that changed.
The POPE value predicted by CHARMM 36 (in the mixture POPC/POPE 50:50) is much smaller than that predicted by Berger.
\todo{The experimental acyl chain order parameters for POPE \cite{pare98} seem larger than reported for POPC \cite{ferreira13},
  which supports the more condensed PE bilayer. In principle, this is beyond the scope of this work (lipid headgroups), but we can
consider mentioning this.}

%\subsection{Effect of PC on PS and PG headgroups}

The headgroup order parameters for PS and PG lipid mixtures with PC
having different mole fractions from simulations and experiments \cite{borle85,roux90}
are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPSPGvsPC}. The effect of increasing
amount of PC to PS headgroup seems to qualitatively incorrect in CHARMM36 simulations.
The $\beta$-carbon order parameter increases in experiment, but decreases
in simulations with both tested counterions (Na+ and K+). Larger
$\alpha$-carbon order parameter decreases with the addition of PC
in experiment, while the lower remains unchanged. In simulations the
larger increases and the lower decreases.
Interestingly, the $\alpha$-carbon order parameters are closer to experiments
in pure PS system with K+ counterions than with Na+. 
The changes in PG headgroup order parameters are minor in simulations, which
is in line with the only available experiment for the $\beta$-carbon.

\subsection{Ca$^{2+}$ binding in bilayers with negatively charged PG and PS lipids}

PC lipid headgroup order parameters can used to measure ion binding
affinity, because their magnitude is linearly proportional
to the amount of bound charge in bilayer \cite{seelig87,catte16}.
This molecular electrometer concept can be used also
for bilayers containing PC lipids mixed with charged lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90}.
This is demonstrated in Figs \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M},
showing order parameters for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration in the presence of different amounts of
negatively charged PS or PG lipids.

%    The original data is the same as in Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl}. 
%  }
%\end{figure}

PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%In electrometer concept this is explained by the tilting of
%headgroup more parallel to membrane normal \cite{??}.
Further, the order parameters decrease with the addition
of CaCl$_2$ and the decrease is more pronounced for systems with more
negatively charged lipids (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
At CaCl$_2$ concentrations ($\sim$ 50-300mM) where order parameters reach the values for pure PC,
the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
overcharging occurs above these concenterations.
The interpretation of this data and some other results has been that \cite{seelig90}
\begin{displayquote}
  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
\end{displayquote}


Comparison of Ca$2+$ binding in PG between CHARMM36 simulations and experiments \cite{borle85}
is shown in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG}. The decrease of $\alpha$ order parameter
is in agreement with experiments, while decerase of $\beta$ order parameter is overestimated.
The result is very similar to the results with PC in NMRlipids II publication \cite{catte16}.
It should be, however, noted that the $\beta$-order parameters are not actually measured for PG,
but they are calculated from empirical relation $\Delta S_{\beta}=0.43\Delta S_{\alpha}$ \cite{akutsu81}.
Anyway, the data presented in NMRlipids II project and in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} together
suggest that Calcium binding is similarly overestimated by CHARMM36 model in pure POPC bilayers and mixtures with
POPG. The good agreement of $\alpha$ carbon would be explained by too weak dependence of its order
parameter of bound charge

  }
\end{figure*}

Also dependence of $\beta$-carbon of PG on CaCl$_2$ concentration is compared with
experiments \cite{borle85} in Fig. \ref{PSPGchangesWITHCaCl}. Absolute value of
the order parameter is too large without ions, but rapid decrease due to addition of
CaCl$_2$ is observed in agreement with experiments for systems with 1:1 mixture of POPC and POPG.
In addition, absolute value in systems with CaCl$_2$ is in agreement with experiments.
However, system with 4:1 mixture of POPC and POPG behaves differently, but experimental
data is not available for comparison for this mixture.

%\section{Measurements of order parameter sign}

%Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNS} summarizes the experimental results on the order parameter sign
%measurement for POPS sample. The experimental protocol is the same used in Ref. \citenum{ferreira16}.
%In (a) you see the headgroup region of the INEPT spectrum where alpha and beta are
%identified. In (b) you have the R-PDLF slices for alpha and beta where you see one single
%splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
%of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot be
%calculated. On the bottom you have the S-DROSS slices of these two carbons. The grey lines show a
%random collection of slices from noise such that it gets clear what is significant. The S-DROSS
%slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative. The slice for alpha shows that
%the higher order parameter is positive and suggests that the smaller order parameter is negative
%(from the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times).

%\end{figure}

%The results updated with SIMPSON simulations for the SDROSS profiles
%are shown in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson}. The value for the smaller
%alpha order parameter is taken from Fig 3 in Ref. \citenum{roux91},
%because resolution in 13C NMR experiments was nor high enough to determine
%numerical value for this. The plots in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} (c) show
%the following. The error bars and points are the experimental SDROSS data.
%The thick lines are SIMPSON simulations. The simulations were done by using
%the order parameter for beta equal to -0.12 and for alpha one order parameter
%equal to 0.09 and the other equal to -0.02 (black) or 0.02 (grey).
%Since the black lines agree with experimental data, we conlude that
%the order parameters for $\beta$ carbon are -0.12 and for $\alpha$
%order parameters are 0.09 and -0.02.
