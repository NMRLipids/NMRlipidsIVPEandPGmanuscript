\section{Introduction}

In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
Here we extend the same goal for other than PC lipids.
Currently the focus is on PE, PG and PS bilayers and their
mixtures with PC. Experimental data with different amounts of 
added salt is now collected and presented in this manuscript.

%\end{figure}


Absolute values of experimental order parameters for different lipid headgroups are
collected in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. Signs are measured only for PC as far as I know,
thus only absolute values are used for now.

Based on superficial reading, the conclusions in the literature are roughly \\ 
1) glycerol backbone structures are largely similar irrespectively of the headroup \cite{gally81}, \\
2) glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}, \\
3) headgroup structures are similar in PC, PE and PG lipids, while headgroup is more rigid in PS lipids \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. \\
Extensive discussion about structural details of PE, PG or PS headgroups do not exists (as far as I know), 
In contrast to PC lipids (see \cite{botan15} and references therein).



Several simulations containing PE, PG and PS lipids have been published \cite{??}, \todo{List should be completed}
however, glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are not compared to
the experiments (based on superficial reading of literature).

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Experimental C--H bond order parameters}% from the natural abundance $^{13}$C\,NMR}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone C--H bond order parameter magnitudes and signs of POPE and POPG
were determined by measuring the chemical-shift resolved dipolar splittings
with a R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDLF) experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04} and
%The corresponding order parameter signs were measured with a
S-DROSS experiments~\cite{gross97} using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy
as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16,NMRlipidsIVps}.
%The experiments were done in a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a $^1$H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz.
%Magic angle spinning (MAS) of the sample was used at a frequency of 5.15 kHz (R-PDLF experiment) and 5 kHz (S-DROSS experiment).
%The following experimental setups were used.
\todo{The rest of the details to be written. I am not sure how much we need to repeat the NMRlipidsIVps paper.}

\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulations}

Molecular dynamics simulation data were collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}, with
the NMR\-lipids Project blog (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
GitHub repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems are listed in 
Tables \ref{systems} (pure PE and PG bilayers without additional ions).
and \ref{systemsII} (mixtures and systems with additional ions).
Further simulation details are given in the SI, and
the simulation data are indexed in a
searchable database available at \url{www.nmrlipids.fi},
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/MATCH}).

The C--H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the carbon and hydrogen positions using the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal
(taken to align with $z$, with bilayer periodicity in the $xy$-plane).
Angular brackets denote average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
Python program ({\tt scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}) that uses the
MDAnalysis library \cite{agrawal11,gowers16} is available in Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}. 
The ion number density profiles were calculated using the {\tt gmx density} tool
of the Gromacs sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of POPE and POPG from $^{13}$C NMR}

The glycerol backbone and $\alpha$-carbon peaks in INEPT spectra of POPE were assigned based on
previously measured POPC spectra (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}) \cite{ferreira13}. The $\beta$-carbon peak was assigned based
on $^{13}$C chemical shift table for amines available at \url{https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/nmr/c13-data/cdata.htm}.
The order parameters for the glycerol backbone and headgroup C--H bonds were determined
from 2D-RPDLF and S-DROSS experiments (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}), as described previously \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
The POPE experiments were recorded at 310~K, where the bilayer is in liquid disordered phase \cite{??}.
\todo{Details to be checked by Tiago}.

\todo{Figure and discussion about POPG experiments to be addded.}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of PE lipids are similar with 
different acyl chains and also close the values for POPC, althought PE gives systematically
slightly more positive values (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}). These could be explained with slightly larger temperature
in PE measurements, except for the $\alpha$-carbon with the positive sign, for which the
more positive value is farther away from zero. For PG lipids, the glycerol backbone order
parameters are more positive than for other lipids. The headgroup $\alpha$-carbon gives
value close to PE, while the value of $\beta$-carbon is distinct from other lipid being
only one which has positive sign, suggesting distinct conformation of PG lipids in this region.
This was not observed in previous $^2$H NMR study, where sign was not measured and $\beta$-carbon
order parameter was apparently similar to the value for PE and PC results.

In conclusion, the results suggests that the glycerol backbone conformations in all lipids are
relatively similar. Also, the headgroup conformations are similar for PC and PE lipids, while
PS and PG are singnificantly different. For PS lipids, the differences are discussed previously \cite{??}.

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone of POPE and POPG in MD simulations}

The glycerol backbone order parameters in Slipid simulations are off from experiments
for both PE and PG lipids (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}),
as already reported previously for PC lipids \cite{botan15} and PS lipids \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
The Slipid simulations were able to capture the essential differences between PC and PS lipid
headgroups \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}, but this is not the case for PE and PG lipids.

\todo{Berger results are not here yet, but we should mention the ring like structures
  pointed out by T. Piggot in the blog:
  The poor performance of headgroup order parameters in Berger model can be probably explained by ring like structures seen in Fig. 6 in Ref. \citenum{mukhopadhyay04}.
  These ring like structures are a widespread feature of typical Berger based lipid force fields containing explicit hydrogen atoms in the head group \cite{zhao08,henin09,dahlberg10}.
}

CHARMM36 simulations seems to capture all the essential differences between
headgroup order parameters of PC PE, PG (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}),
as previously observed also for PS lipids \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}. Therefore,
the CHARMM36 simulations can be used to analyze the structural differences between
headgroups \todo{We should do such analysis. Maybe similar to the PS part \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}?}

\subsection{Lipid headgroup interactions in PC:PE and PC:PG mixtures}
According to the electrometer concept, the headgroup order parameters increase
with the addition of negatively charged PG lipids, but
%decrease when mixed with positively charged surfactants and
are not affected by the addition of zwitterionic PE lipids (Fig.~\ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPG}) \cite{seelig87, scherer87}. % or cholesterol.
%In addition to the results summarized in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol},
%also mixtures of PC with negatively charged PI, CL, PA, and zwitterionic SM
%follow the eletrometer concept \cite{scherer87}.
%to mixtures of differently charged
%lipids are collected from different experiments in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}.
%%\section{PC lipid headgroup response to different mixtures in experiments}
%As shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}, order parameters of PC
%headgroup behave in various lipid mixtures as expected from the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87, scherer87},
%i.e., order parameters increase when anionic lipids are mixed with PC and decrease with cationic
%surfactants. The changes with the addition of neutral lipids is significantly smaller.

%The headgroup order parameters for PC lipids (POPC and DOPC)
%mixed with PE, PS and PG lipids are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPG}
%from different simulation model and experiments \cite{scherer87} with different
%mole fractions. As already discussed previosly, the PC lipid headgroup behaviour
%follows the electrometer concept in experiments when mixed with other lipids, i.e., the order
%parameters increase when mixed with negatively charged lipids (PS, PI, CL, PA and PG)
%remains almost unchaged when mixed with neutral lipids (PE and SM) \cite{scherer87}.
This is roughly observed also in simulations here, althouht the changes in PC headgroup with
PE are slightly overestimated and changes with PG lipid are slightly underestimated.
The underestimated increase of PC headgroup order parameters with the addition of
negaticely charged lipids was previously interepreted to indicate overestimated
counterion binding affinity, which overcompensates the effect of negative charge \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
Thus, the counterion binding to PG lipid bilayers (Fig. \ref{CIdensPG}) may be slightly
overestimated also in simulations here.

One can see that CHARMM 36 predicts a drop in the area on going from pure POPC to POPC/POPE 50:50. This means that POPC pack tightly to POPE. 
In contrast, the values for Berger are not that changed. 
The POPE value predicted by CHARMM 36 (in the mixture POPC/POPE 50:50) is much smaller than that predicted by Berger.\\
-------\\
The experimental acyl chain order parameters for POPE \cite{pare98} seem larger than reported for POPC \cite{ferreira13},
  which supports the more condensed PE bilayer. In principle, this is beyond the scope of this work (lipid headgroups), but we can
consider mentioning this.}


The order parameter of headgroup $\beta$-carbon of PG slightly increases with the addition
of PC \cite{macdonald87}, althought also smaller changes have been observed~\cite{borle85}
(Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPSPGvsPC}).
The increase in PG headgroup order parameter is not observed in simulations, which
may arise from overestimated counterion binding overcompensating the changes in
electrostatic environment as suggested for PC headgroup above. However, the changes
are quite small and not fully consistent in experiments.

\subsection{Cation binding to PE and PG lipid bilayers}
The headgroup order parameters of PC lipids can used to measure ion binding
affinity to lipid bilayers, because their magnitude is linearly proportional
to the amount of bound charge in bilayer according to the molecular
electrometer concept \cite{seelig87,catte16}. The molecular electrometer concept
can be used also for bilayers containing PC lipids mixed with charged
lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90,NMRlipidsIVps}.
%This is demonstrated in Figs \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
%\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M},
%showing order parameters for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
%as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration in the presence of different amounts of
%negatively charged PS or PG lipids.
%
%PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
%PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
%as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
%(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%Further, the order parameters decrease with the addition
%of CaCl$_2$ and the decrease is more pronounced for systems with more
%negatively charged lipids (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%At CaCl$_2$ concentrations ($\sim$ 50-300mM) where order parameters reach the values for pure PC,
%the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
%overcharging occurs above these concenterations.
Based on the electrometer concept and other data is has been suggested that \cite{seelig90}
\begin{displayquote}
  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
\end{displayquote}
The electrometer concept has been very useful in evaluating ion binding affinity in simulations
against experiments, because the headgroup order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration
can be directly compared with experiments \cite{catte16,melcr18,NMRlipidsIVps}.

Sodium binding to PC lipid bilayers is significantly overestimated by most simulations models \cite{catte16}.
Also, sodium binding to PS lipids seems to be overestimated, although the
presence of counterions complicate the comparison for negatively charged lipids \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
Sodium binding to PE lipids is weaker than to PC lipids in previous work \cite{catte16} in both CHARMM36 and Slipids simulations (Fig. \ref{NAdensPE}).
This cannot be evaluated using electrometer concept because experimental data with PE lipids is not
available \todo{Other experimental data should be checked and discussed}.
The difference in Slipids may also be due to different ion model used \todo{The used ion model here should be checked}.
\begin{figure}[]

  \includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{../Figs/NAdensPE.eps}
  \caption{\label{NAdensPE}
    Sodium (solid line) and choride ion density profiles along membrane normal
    from different simulations with PE lipids.
  }
\end{figure}

Calcium binding affinity to PC and PS lipid bilayers was not correctly described by
any of the standard MD simulation forced fields \cite{catte16,NMRlipidsIVps}, while
recently introduced force field with electronic continuum correction (ECC) performed better \cite{melcr18}.
The decrease of $\alpha$-carbon order parameter of PC lipids in PC:PG mixtures as a function
of calcium concentration is close to experiments CHARMM36 simulations (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG}),
but the decrease of $\beta$-carbon order parameter seems to be overestimated.
However, the $\beta$-carbon order parameter was not actually measured from these samples,
but they are calculated from empirical relation $\Delta S_{\beta}=0.43\Delta S_{\alpha}$ \cite{akutsu81}.
The result is similar to the $\sim$200~ns simulations with PC lipids in previous work \cite{catte16}.
However, when simulation was continued for $\mu$s, the binding affinity substantially increased
and interpretation was that calcium overbinds to PC lipid in CHARMM36. Therefore, the
conclusion seems to be similar here, although the new NBfix parameters may complicate
the situation \todo{The status of NBfix parameters in these simulations should be checked.}.
%Anyway, the data presented in NMRlipids II project and in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} together
%suggest that Calcium binding is similarly overestimated by CHARMM36 model in pure POPC bilayers and mixtures with
%POPG. The good agreement of $\alpha$ carbon would be explained by too weak dependence of its order
%parameter of bound charge

%  I have already ran the simulations, analysis to be done.}.

The $\beta$-carbon order parameter of PG exhibits a rapid decrease with small CaCl$_2$ concentrations
and a more modest decrease with larger concentrations in experiments \cite{borle85} (Fig. \ref{PSPGchangesWITHCaCl}).
The rapid decrease with CaCl$_2$ is observed but overestimated in CHARMM36 simulation
with POPC:POPG 1:1 mixture, but not in 4:1 mixture \todo{This is little bit weird, should be checked.}.

%\section{Measurements of order parameter sign}

%Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNS} summarizes the experimental results on the order parameter sign
%measurement for POPS sample. The experimental protocol is the same used in Ref. \citenum{ferreira16}.
%In (a) you see the headgroup region of the INEPT spectrum where alpha and beta are
%identified. In (b) you have the R-PDLF slices for alpha and beta where you see one single
%splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
%of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot be
%calculated. On the bottom you have the S-DROSS slices of these two carbons. The grey lines show a
%random collection of slices from noise such that it gets clear what is significant. The S-DROSS
%slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative. The slice for alpha shows that
%the higher order parameter is positive and suggests that the smaller order parameter is negative
%(from the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times).

%The results updated with SIMPSON simulations for the SDROSS profiles
%are shown in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson}. The value for the smaller
%alpha order parameter is taken from Fig 3 in Ref. \citenum{roux91},
%because resolution in 13C NMR experiments was nor high enough to determine
%numerical value for this. The plots in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} (c) show
%the following. The error bars and points are the experimental SDROSS data.
%The thick lines are SIMPSON simulations. The simulations were done by using
%the order parameter for beta equal to -0.12 and for alpha one order parameter
%equal to 0.09 and the other equal to -0.02 (black) or 0.02 (grey).
%Since the black lines agree with experimental data, we conlude that
%the order parameters for $\beta$ carbon are -0.12 and for $\alpha$
%order parameters are 0.09 and -0.02.
