\section{Introduction}

Lipid composition of biomembranes vary greatly between different
organelles and organism, and different lipid types interact with
proteins in many different ways regulating their function \cite{??}.
Lipids may directly interact with proteins by specific binding sites
or indirectly affect protein functions by altering membrane properties
or charge \cite{??}. Specific interactions with certain lipid headgroups
are known to be essential for the function of several proteins \cite{??}.
However, it is not clear if the specific binding is driven by
the differences in acessible conformational states between lipid types or
by specific intermolecular interactions between lipids and proteins.

Differences between preferred conformations of different lipid types
are observed in lipid crystal structures \cite{buldt81,pascher92},
but lipids are not in solid state in biomembranes. 
On the other hand, NMR experiments enable detection of lipid headgroups
in physiological liquid states also in cells \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}.
These studies suggest that the glycerol backbone structures are largely similar irrespectively of the headroup \cite{gally81}, 
glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90},
and the headgroup structures are similar in PC, PE and PG lipids, while headgroup is more rigid in PS lipids \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. 
%Extensive discussion about structural details of PE, PG or PS headgroups do not exists (as far as I know), 
%In contrast to PC lipids (see \cite{botan15} and references therein).
%Some attempts to resolve conformational ensembles from NMR for PC and PE lipids have been made,
%but lesser extend for PG or PS lipids \cite{seelig77c,davis83,Semchyschyn04}.
Attempts to resolve the conformational ensembles of lipid headgroup rely mainly on
absolute values of C-H bond order parameters measured using $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig77c,davis83,Semchyschyn04}.
However, appropriate models to interpret the experimental data have not been available and
also the signs of the order parameters are required to fully capture the details in conformational ensembles  \cite{botan15,ollila16}.
%determine the structural 
%Classical molecular dynamics simulations could potentially give such ensembles and therefore enable
%the detailed studies of lipid headgroup behaviour in complex biomolecular systems, but current
%force fields are not accurate enough to reproduce the correct conformational ensembles for PC and PS headgroups \cite{botan15,antila19}.


PE and PG lipids are most common lipids in bacteria \cite{sohlenkamp16}.
Zwitterionic PE is the second most abundant glycerophospholipid in eukaryotic cells
and has been related to the diseases \cite{vance15,calzada16,patel17}.
Anionic PG lipids are less abundant, but is also proposed to be fundamental for terrestrial life \cite{furse17}.
PE and PG affect membrane protein functionality \cite{hariharan18} and bind to various proteins \cite{yeagle14}.
PE headgroup is also prone for negative membrane curvature and causes membrane fusion \cite{Chernomordik08,calzada16}.
Therefore, the PE and PG headgroup structures play probably essential roles in 
many biological processes.


%Several MD simulations of PE and PG lipids have been published especially in the context of modeling
%inner membrane of Gram-negative
%bacteria \cite{devries04,murzyn05,pedersen06,zhao07,gurtovenko08,zhao08,henin09,kukol09,tsai12,dickson12,venable13,dickson14,berglund15}
%\todo{There may be some relevant publication missing from here},
%but evaluation of glycerol backbone and headgroup structures against experiments is rare \cite{henin09}.

Derivation of different lipid headgroup conformational ensembles in liquid state has been
inconclusive due to lack of suitable experimental data and tools to interpret the conformational ensembles.


Besides the structure, also ion binding may regulate biophysical activity of especially negatively
charged lipid headgroups \cite{seelig90}. Monovalent cation (except Lithium) binding to zwitterionic PC and anionic PS headgroups is
very weak, while multivalent ion binding is stronger but still weak \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,roux90,catte16,antila19}. The ion binding affinity
data for PE is more scarce \cite{marra85}, but large differences to PC would be surprising.
Negatively charged lipids are suggested to bear same cation binding constants than zwitterionic lipids, but
the amount of bound ions to negatively charged membranes would still be larger because
the concentration of cations in the vicinity of membranes would be higher  \cite{seelig90}.
%is stronger
%Based on the electrometer concept and other data is has been suggested that \cite{seelig90}
%\begin{displayquote}
%  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
%    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
%    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
%    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
%    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
%    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
%    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
%    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
%    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
%    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
%\end{displayquote}
On the other hand, anionic PS lipids are proposed chelate with calcium ions \cite{hauser85,feigenson86,roux91}.
In simulations, the cation binding affinity to PC and PS membranes is typically overestimated \cite{catte16,antila19},
which can be improved by applying the ECC to the partial charges of the force fields \cite{melcr18,melcr19}.

Here, we use open collaboration and order parameters of glycerol backbone and headgroup
to evaluate the accuracy of PE and PG heagroup structures, and the cation binding affinity

to anionic membranes containing PG lipids in the current MD simulation force fields.
The force field giving the best description for glycerol backbone and headgroup structures
of PC, PS, PG and PE headgroups (CHARMM36) reproduces the essential differences in order parameters
between these headgroups, and therefore enables the analysis of structural differences between the
headgroups.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Experimental C--H bond order parameters}
The headgroup and glycerol backbone C--H bond order parameter magnitudes and signs of POPE and POPG
were determined by measuring the chemical-shift resolved dipolar splittings
with a R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDLF) experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04} and
%The corresponding order parameter signs were measured with a
S-DROSS experiments~\cite{gross97} using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy
as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16}.
%The experiments were done in a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a $^1$H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz.
%Magic angle spinning (MAS) of the sample was used at a frequency of 5.15 kHz (R-PDLF experiment) and 5 kHz (S-DROSS experiment).
%The following experimental setups were used.
POPE and POPG powder were purchased from Avanti polar lipids.
The NMR experiments were identical to our previous work~\cite{antila19}.
\todo{Is this enough and correct, or should we repeat some methods from the NMRlipidsIVps paper?}
The POPE experiments were recorded at 310~K and POPG experiments at 298~K, where the bilayers are in the liquid disordered phase \cite{marsh13}.

Absolute values of the headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters from PE and PG lipids are measured
previously using $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig76,gally81,wohlgemuth80,borle85}. Because also the order parameter
signs bear essential information about the lipid structures \cite{botan15,ollila16}, we measured the
magnitudes and signs of POPE and POPG C--H bond headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameter in liquid phase
using the 2D-RPDLF and S-DROSS experiments, as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16,antila19}.
For POPE, the glycerol backbone and $\alpha$-carbon peaks in INEPT spectra were assigned based on
previously measured POPC spectra~\cite{ferreira13} and
the $\beta$-carbon peak was assigned based on $^{13}$C chemical shift table for amines available
at \url{https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/nmr/c13-data/cdata.htm} (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}).
For POPG, the glycerol backbone peaks in INEPT spectra were assigned based on
previously measured POPC spectra~\cite{ferreira13}, while $\alpha$ and  $\gamma$-carbon peaks
\todo{How were these assigned?} (Fig. \ref{POPGspectra}). The numerical value of the $\beta$-carbon
order parameter could not be determined, because its peak overlapped with the g$_2$ peak from glycerol backbone in POPG.
However, the order parameter of $\beta$-carbon is expected to be clearly smaller than for g$_2$
based on previous $^2$H NMR measurements \cite{wohlgemuth80,gally81,borle85}.
Therefore, the beginning of the S-DROSS curve gives the sign for g$_2$ order parameter and end for $\beta$ (Fig. \ref{POPGspectra} (E)).
This is confirmed with SIMPSON calculations using negative value for g$_2$ and positive value for $\beta$ order parameter (Fig. \ref{POPGsimpson}).
\todo{Details to be checked by Tiago}.

\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulations}

Molecular dynamics simulation data were collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}, with
the NMR\-lipids Project blog (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
GitHub repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems of pure PE and PG bilayers without additional ions
are listed in Tables \ref{systemsPE} and \ref{systemsPG},
and lipid mixtures with additional ions in Table~\ref{systemsMIX}.
Further simulation details are given in the SI, and
the simulation data are indexed in a
searchable database available at \url{www.nmrlipids.fi},
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/MATCH}).

The C--H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the carbon and hydrogen positions using the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal
(taken to align with $z$, with bilayer periodicity in the $xy$-plane).
Angular brackets denote average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
Python programs that use the MDAnalysis library \cite{agrawal11,gowers16}
used for all atom simulations is available in Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}
({\tt scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}). For united atom simulations, the trajectories
with hydrogens having ideal geometry were constructed first using either buildH program~\cite{buildH}
or ({\tt scratch/opAAUA\_prod.py}) in  Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}, and the order parameters were
then calculated from these trajectories. This approach has been tested against trajectories
with explicit hydrogens and the deviations in order parameters are small \cite{buildH,piggot17}.\\
\todo{BuildH program is now cited with a direct link to the GitHub repo. I think that a release to Zenodo would be nice in the final publication.}\\
\todo{Maybe we should also shortly discuss here about the reasons for slight dependence of order parameter values on the method used to reconstruct hydrogens?}\\
The ion number density profiles were calculated using the {\tt gmx density} tool
of the Gromacs sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

\subsection{Analysis of molecular dynamics simulation data}
The big data set of MD simulations was analysed in the NMRlipids databank manner.
Unique naming convention for lipid atoms in each force field was defined using the mapping files
and analysis for all simulations indexed in NMRlipids databank manner were performed
using python codes.

\subsection{Analysis of lipid conformations bound to proteins}
Dihedral angles of all available conformations in the PDB databank were calculated using the
API access to the databank.

\subsection{Conformational ensembles of different lipid headgroups in bulk bilayer}

To experimentally characterize the differences in lipid headgroup conformational ensembles
in liquid bilayer phase, we measured the C-H bond order parameters magnitudes and signs
from POPG and POPE bilayers.
Order parameters for POPE are in good agreement with previous $^2$H NMR experiments \cite{seelig76}
and similar to our previous results for POPC \cite{ferreira16}.
In POPG, the $\beta$ and g$_2$ carbons have similar chemical environment and their peaks
overlap in the NMR spectra (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters} B).
The signs of these order parameters were solved using SIMPSON simulations to interpre the
S-DROSS experiments in similar fashion as we did previously for PS lipids \cite{antila19}.
The resulting order parameters are compared with our previously published results
for POPC \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16} and POPS \cite{antila19} in figure \ref{HGorderParameters} D.

%Our experimental order parameters, including the signs, from different lipid headgroups
%combined with the literature data are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}.
%Also the headgroup order parameters of PC lipids are close PE, althought the latter gives systematically
%slightly more positive values (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}).
% These could be explained with slightly larger temperature in PE measurements, except for the $\alpha$-carbon with the positive sign, for which the
% more positive value is farther away from zero.
%While the headgroup order parameters are similar for PC and PE lipids,
%PG and PS lipids exhibit distinct values in comparison with other lipids.

The most distinct order parameters are observed for PS and PG headgroups.
In PS, the $\alpha$-carbon order parameter exhibits significant forking
and the $\beta$-carbon has more negative value than in other lipids.
In PG headgroup,
%the $\alpha$-carbon order parameter is similar to PE and PG, while
the $\beta$-carbon order parameter has positive sign in contrast to all the other lipids.
Notably, this has not been observed in traditional $^2$H NMR experiments,
%because absolute value of $\beta$-carbon order parameter is similar in PG, PE and PC lipids and
where only the absolute value of the order parameters are measured~\cite{wohlgemuth80,gally81,borle85}.
The glycerol backbone order parameters are similar for all the lipids, although they move slightly toward
positive values (closer to zero) in the order PC $<$ PE $<$ PS $<$ PG. 

%As discussed previously for PC and PS headgroups \cite{ollila16,antila19}, also 
%the headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of PE and PG are essentially independent of 
%acyl chain composition, and therefore manifest mainly headgroup chemistry (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}).

To characterize the differences in lipid headgroup conformational ensembles
leading to the distinct order parameters in PS and PG lipids, we calculate the
the distributions of heavy atom dihedral angles from CHARMM36 simulations.
Among available simulation models, this force field has least problems in
reproducing the experimental lipid headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters in different
lipids \cite{botan15,antila19} (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}).
Importantly, it captures the experimentally observed distinct order parameters for PS and PG headgroups (Fig. \ref{??}).
The dihedral distributions in figure \ref{structures} show significant similarity between different lipids for all the other
bonds, except for the last two bonds in the headgroup end, O$_\alpha$-C$_\alpha$ and  C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$.
These differences explaing the disctinct order parameters of
PS and PG headgroups with respenct to the other lipids.
The difference between PC and PE lipids in the O$_\alpha$-C$_\alpha$ bond dihedral
may be an artefact because the $\beta$-carbon order parameter in PC is poorly reproduced by the CHARMM36 force field \cite{botan15}.
The differences between lipids are reflected also to the 
angle between headgroup dipole and membrane normal,
which decreases in the order of PG $>$ PE  $>$ PC  $>$ PS (Fig. \ref{structures}). 

%
%As in previous NMRlipids project results for PC and PS lipids \cite{botan15,antila19},
%none of the MD simulation force fields correctly captures all the
%headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of PE and PG lipids
%(Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG})
%that would enable a straightforward interpretation of conformational ensembles.
%
%show wide variation between different force fields
%and none of the force fields reproduce all values within experimental error bars.
%(Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}),
%as observed previously also for PC and PS lipids \cite{botan15,antila19}.
%The Slipid simulations were able to capture the essential differences between PC and PS lipid
%headgroups \cite{antila19}, but this is not the case for PE and PG lipids.
%Without further discussion about poorly performing force fields, we focus on more detailed analysis
%of
%
%Nevertheless, CHARMM36 force field, which gives the results closest to the experiments for all lipids,
%captures the essential differences between
%PC, PS, PG and PE headroup order parameters  (Fig.~\ref{structures}) with the exception of $\beta$-carbon order parameter of PC
%
%give the best overall agreement with experiments for
%the headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of all PC, PS, PG and PE lipids in this and our previous
%studies \cite{botan15,antila19}. Even thought many order parameters in CHARMM36 simulations are
%not within the experimental error bars, it 
%
%which is too negative when compared with other lipids or experiments \cite{botan15}.
%
% As already pointed out in our previous study \cite{antila19},

The analysis of dihedral angle distributions reveal the free rotation of dihedral around
phosphorus-oxygen bonds in all lipids as all possible angles are observed in the distributions.
Results in figure \ref{structure} support the recently proposed models where this free rotation 
decouples the dynamics and conformational ensembles between acyl chains and headgroup in all lipids containing
the phosphorus group \cite{antila21}. 
However, some dihedral angles of phosphorus-oxygen bonds are less likely for PS, which
%suggests that the decoupling may be weaker for PS lipids
possibly explains the more rigid headgroup structures proposed for PS lipids~\cite{browning80,buldt81}.

%The eclipsed (0 or 360 degrees) are not present in any other dihedrals, and anti-eclipsed (120 or 240 degrees)
%are not present in C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$ and g$_1$-g$_2$ bonds.


%Characteristic dihedral conformations in PS headgroup are asymmetric conformations
%preferring gauche 270$^\circ$ conformations in N-C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$ and
%%dihedral exhibits a more asymmetric angle distribution for PS, having largest probability being
%%in , than for the PC headgroup.
%C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$-P dihedrals. 
%In PG headgroup, the O$_\beta$-C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$ dihedral (corresponding N-C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$ dihedral in other% lipids)
%is mostly in trans conformation, and C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$-P  has asymmetric tendency to be in
%gauche 60$^\circ$ conformation. 
%Main difference between PC and PE is the lower probability of trans state in C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$-P PC dihedral,
%which could be a potential reason for the too negative $\beta$ headgroup order parameter in PC.%

\end{figure*}


In conclusion, all lipid headgroups sample very broad conformational ensembles in liquid lamellar phase.
%the results suggest that free rotations around O-P bonds decouple the
%headgroup and glycerol backbone structure and dynamics in similarly in all lipids,
%althought this rotation is slower in PS lipids where crossing certain barriers are slower.
Despite the differences in dihedral distributions of two the last bonds at the headgroup end,
leading to the distinct order parameters for PS and PG lipids,
lipids with different headgroup sample dihedral angles within approximately same ranges.
Altogether, our results suggest that lipid headgroups and very flexible thereby being
able to adopt multiple conformations when interacting with proteins, ions or other biomolecules.
Furthermore, approximately same conformations are present liquid lamellar phase for different
headgroups studied here, althought the probability weight for the conformations are slightly different.
%the order parameter experiments suggest that the glycerol backbone conformations in all lipids
%and the headgroup conformations in PC and PE lipids are relatively similar, while 
%PS and PG headgropus exhibit distinct conformational sampling.
%The details of sampled conformation are difficult to deduce from order parameters only,
%but the distinct headgroup order parameters
%of PS lipids are previously related to the more rigid structure of the headgroup~\cite{browning80,buldt81,antila19}.



\subsection{Lipid conformational ensembles in lipid bilayers with bound ions}
%Phosphatidylcholine headgroup conformational ensemble and orientation are unchanged
%upon addition of neutral molecules such as cholesterol or sphingomyelin into a bilayer,
%while
Order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in PC lipid headgroup are known to depend
linearly on the incorporation of charged molecules into a lipid bilayer,
which is explained by tilting of the headgroup dipole orientation \cite{??}.
%are kn affect the headgroup dipole vector tilt which can
%be detected by measuring C-H bond order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons.
Such changes have been observed upon addition of charged lipids, proteins, surfactants,
drugs, or ions \cite{??}, but how charges affect the lipid conformational ensemble remains unknown.
%Headgroup order parameters of PC lipids decrease or increase upon addition of positive
%or negative charge into membrane, respectively, while they remain 
%\cite{??}.
%This has been explained by the tilting of the headgroup dipole due to electrostatic

The experimentally measured decrease of PC headgroup order parameters upon addition of cationic surfactants into a bilayer
are well captured by CHARMM36 simulations in figure \ref{changesWITHsurf} A,
suggesting that these simulations can be used to interpret how lipid headgroup conformational ensembles
respond to the binding of positively charged into a membrane.
Charactization of conformational ensembles using heavy atom dihedral angle distributions in figure \ref{changesWITHsurf} B
reveal that choline region is essentially unchanged upon addition of carge.
The major changes upon addition of charge are observed in dihedrals related to the phosphate oxygens,
while small change is observed also in the g$_2$-g$_3$ bond in the glycerol backbone.
This result is in line with the recently proposed model suggesting that the flexible phosphate enables the headgroup
orient according to the charge accumulated into a membrane \cite{antila21}.

Headgroup order parameters of PC lipids respond similarly also to the addition of charged lipids in experiments \cite{??}.
To resolve the conformational ensembles of lipid headgroups also in biologically relevant
mixtures, % of zwitterionic and charged lipids,
we compared the response of headgroup order parameters in
PC lipids to the addition of PE or PG (Fig. \ref{??}),
as well as in PG lipids to the addition of PC (Fig. \ref{??}),
between simulations and experiments. However, the accuracy of currently available force fields
is not sufficient to capture the headgroup conformational ensembles
in mixed membranes: 
The best performing force field for single componen membranes, CHARMM36, overestimates
the effect of PE to PC conformations and underestimates the response PC to the addition
of anionic PG headgroup. Previously we explained similar result for PC/PS mixtures  
%as we previously observed also for mixtures with PS lipids \cite{antila19}.
%The latter may arise from
by overbinding of the sodium counterions \cite{antila19}.

In order to analyze how conformational ensemble of PC and PG lipids response to the
bound ions, we compared the changes of headgroup order parameters
in POPC:POPG (1:1) and (4:1) mixtures upon addition of CaCl$_2$ from different simulations
to the experimental data available in the literature \cite{borle85,macdonald87}
in figures \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} and \ref{changesWITHCaClPG1PC4}.
As in our previous studies \cite{catte16,melcr18,antila19,melcr20},  
%The decrease of POPC headgroup order parameters in mixtures with POPG lipids with
%increasing CaCl$_2$ concentration is overestimated in Slipids and Lipid17
%order parameters decrease in the response to bound cations in qualitative agreement with
%experiments, but
the calcium binding affinity to membranes is typically overestimated in simulations,
except by CHARMM36 with the NBfix correction which underestimates the binding affinity,
and the implicit inclusion of electronic polarizability improves the results.
Lipid17ecc model with the implicit inclusion of electronic polarizability gives
the most realistic response of PC lipid headgroup order parameters to the binding of calcium.
In this model, the main effect of calcium to the lipid conformational ensemble is
%the decrease is headgroup order parameters observed in this model is
the slight change of g$_3$-O$_{g3}$-P-O$_\alpha$ dihedral distribution from trans state
to eclipsed conformations (Fig. \ref{DIHSwithCAlipid17eccPOPC}).
This is in line with the changes observed in CHARMM36 simulations upon addition of charged surgactants (Fig. \ref{changesWITHsurf}),
despite the major differences in lipid headgroup conformational ensembles between
these models without ions (Fig. \ref{structures} vs. Fig. \ref{DIHSwithCAlipid17eccPOPC}).

%Changes in lipid conformational ensembles characterized by distributions of heavy atom dihedral angles

%Yet, such changes are sufficient to tilt the headgroup dipole angle and reproduce the experimentally observed
%order parameter changes in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons. 


%Among the available simulations, there are two models that correctly reproduce the
%PG headgroup order parameter changes upon addition of calcium, Lipid17 and Slipids,
%even though the binding affinity of calcium is overestimated in these simulations.

%The decrease of $\alpha$-carbon order parameter of PC lipids in PC:PG mixtures as a function
%of calcium concentration is close to experiments CHARMM36 simulations (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG}),
%but the decrease of $\beta$-carbon order parameter seems to be overestimated.
%However, the $\beta$-carbon order parameter was not actually measured from these samples,
%but they are calculated from empirical relation $\Delta S_{\beta}=0.43\Delta S_{\alpha}$ \cite{akutsu81}.
%On the other hand, the simulations are not converged.
%
%The calcium binding affinity to lipid bilayers with PC and PS lipids
%was recently improved by applying the electronic continuum correction (ECC) to Amber Lipid14/17 force fields \cite{melcr18,melcr20}.
%In this approach, the electronic polarizability is implicitly included in the classical force fields
%by scaling the charges with constant factors \cite{leontyev11}. Here, we make a ECC-POPG force field
%by applying the scaling factors originally used for POPS also to POPG, i.e., we multiply
%charges and Lennard-Jones $\sigma$s of headgroup, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions with 
%$f_q$=0.75 and $f_\sigma$=0.89, respectively \cite{melcr20}.
%ECC-POPG model gives a weaker calcium binding affinity (Fig.\ref{CAdensPG}) and better agreement with the experimental

%\todo{We still need more data to finish the discussion. More detailed discussion is in https://github.com/NMRLipids/NMRlipidsIVPEandPG/issues/12}

Despite the limited cabability of simulations to interpret some experimental data due to
the inaccuries in force fields, we can conclude that the experimentally observed changes
in headgroup order parameters upon addition of charges into bilayer arise from relatively
small changes in conformational ensembles. These changes can be characterised by
mild changes in dihedral angle distributions, rather than restriction of lipids into
fixed conformations. Therefore, lipid headgroups remain in disordered state sampling large
space of different conformations, thereby being able to interact with different molecules
in various ways, also when charged molecules are bound to membranes.



\subsection{Protein bound lipid conformations}

While our results in previous sections suggest that lipid headgroups
sample large conformational space in liquid lamellar phase, lipids
can bound to proteins in fixed conformations which can be then detected
using crystallography or cryo-EM. Such protein bound lipid conformations are
available within protein structures deposited in The Protein Data Bank (PDB)
available at \url{http://www.rcsb.org/} \cite{berman00}. With our criterias described
in the methods, we found
?? conformations of PC lipids,
?? conformations of PE lipids,
?? conformations of PG lipids, and
?? conformations of PS lipids from PDB.

  \caption{\label{dihedralsFROMpdb}

\end{figure}

To analyze the relation of lipid headgroup conformational ensembles between
liquid lamellar and protein bound states, we calculated the heavy atom dihedral angle
distributions also from the protein conformations found from the PDB.
The results in figure \ref{dihedralsFROMpdb} do not reveal major differences
between different lipid headgroups when bound to proteins.
Some preference for trans state in C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$ bond of PC lipids, and
for positive angles in O$_\alpha$-C$_\alpha$ and P-O$_\alpha$ of PS lipids with respect
to other lipids may be present in the data, but more statistics is required for solid
conclusions. Therefore, the differences in conformational ensembles between different
lipids observed in liquid lamellar state are not clearly visible in the protein bound states.

Almost all dihedral angles are found from the protein bounds states for all dihedrals
except for P-O$_\alpha$-C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$ and g$_2$-g$_3$-O$_{g_3}$-P, which seem to avoid
the cis conformations. The wide range of available dihedrals is similar to our results
in liquid lamellar state, except for O$_\alpha$-C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$-/C$_\gamma$ and
g$_1$-g$_2$-g$_3$-O$_{g_3}$ dihedrals which seem to be more restricted in the liquid
lamellar phase (Fig. \ref{structures}). This suggests that lipids compromize their
preferred conformations when bound to proteins to minimize the intermolecular interactions
with proteins.

\section{Conclusions}

We have measured the C-H bond order parameters with the signs for headgroup and glycerol
backbone regions of the most most abundant biological phopholipids, PC, PE, PG and PS.
Combining this experimental data with the large amount of simulation data collected 
using the NMRlipids open collaboration, we were able to resolve the differences between
conformational ensembles of lipid headgroup leading to the differences observed in NMR experiments.

Our results indicate that lipid headgroups are flexible and sample large conformational space
in biologically relevant liquid lamellar state, also in membranes containing charged molecules,
which have the largest affect on lipid headgroups in NMR experiments.
Therefore, lipids can bind to proteins and other biomolecules in multiple different conformations,
as indeed observed in the analysis of protein bound lipid conformations available from PDB.
The weak correlation between lipid structures in liquid lamellar phase and protein bound state
suggestst that the selective lipid binding to proteins is dominated by the intermolecular lipid-protein
interactions, and the differences in conformational ensembles between different lipid types
play only a minor role.

Our results pave the way to understand how lipids regulate membrane protein function.
For example, the resolved lipid conformational ensembles in liquid lamellar phase and
realistic MD simulations enables accurate analysis of lipid-protein interactions energetics.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate how NMR data can be combined with the large amount of
indexed MD simulation data to find the most realistic conformational ensembles of biomolecules
in membrane environment. This paves the way toward standardized methods to resolve the quality
evaluated conformational ensembles of disordered biomolecules in membrane environment.
In the NMRlipids project we aim to build a general databank of quality evaluated
conformational ensembles of lipids and other disordered biomolecules based primarily on
MD simulations and NMR data.

%\section{Measurements of order parameter sign}

%Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNS} summarizes the experimental results on the order parameter sign
%measurement for POPS sample. The experimental protocol is the same used in Ref. \citenum{ferreira16}.
%In (a) you see the headgroup region of the INEPT spectrum where alpha and beta are
%identified. In (b) you have the R-PDLF slices for alpha and beta where you see one single
%splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
%of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot be
%calculated. On the bottom you have the S-DROSS slices of these two carbons. The grey lines show a
%random collection of slices from noise such that it gets clear what is significant. The S-DROSS
%slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative. The slice for alpha shows that
%the higher order parameter is positive and suggests that the smaller order parameter is negative
%(from the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times).

%The results updated with SIMPSON simulations for the SDROSS profiles

%the order parameter for beta equal to -0.12 and for alpha one order parameter
%equal to 0.09 and the other equal to -0.02 (black) or 0.02 (grey).
%Since the black lines agree with experimental data, we conlude that

%order parameters are 0.09 and -0.02.
