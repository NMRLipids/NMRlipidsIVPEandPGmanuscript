\section{Introduction}

In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
Here we extend the same goal for other than PC lipids.
Currently the focus is on PE, PG and PS bilayers and their
mixtures with PC. Experimental data with different amounts of 
added salt is now collected and presented in this manuscript.

PE and PG affect membrane protein functionality \cite{hariharan18} and bind to various proteins \cite{yeagle14}.

%\end{figure}


Experimental order parameters for different lipid headgroups are
collected in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. 

Based on superficial reading, the conclusions in the literature are roughly \\ 
1) glycerol backbone structures are largely similar irrespectively of the headroup \cite{gally81}, \\
2) glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}, \\
3) headgroup structures are similar in PC, PE and PG lipids, while headgroup is more rigid in PS lipids \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. \\
Extensive discussion about structural details of PE, PG or PS headgroups do not exists (as far as I know), 
In contrast to PC lipids (see \cite{botan15} and references therein).



Several simulations containing PE, PG and PS lipids have been published \cite{??}, \todo{List should be completed}
however, glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are not compared to
the experiments (based on superficial reading of literature).

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Experimental C--H bond order parameters}% from the natural abundance $^{13}$C\,NMR}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone C--H bond order parameter magnitudes and signs of POPE and POPG
were determined by measuring the chemical-shift resolved dipolar splittings
with a R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDLF) experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04} and
%The corresponding order parameter signs were measured with a
S-DROSS experiments~\cite{gross97} using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy
as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16,NMRlipidsIVps}.
%The experiments were done in a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a $^1$H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz.
%Magic angle spinning (MAS) of the sample was used at a frequency of 5.15 kHz (R-PDLF experiment) and 5 kHz (S-DROSS experiment).
%The following experimental setups were used.
\todo{The rest of the details to be written. I am not sure how much we need to repeat the NMRlipidsIVps paper.}

\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulations}

Molecular dynamics simulation data were collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}, with
the NMR\-lipids Project blog (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
GitHub repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems are listed in 
Tables \ref{systems} (pure PE and PG bilayers without additional ions).
and \ref{systemsII} (mixtures and systems with additional ions).
Further simulation details are given in the SI, and
the simulation data are indexed in a
searchable database available at \url{www.nmrlipids.fi},
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH repository (\url{github.com/NMRlipids/MATCH}).

The C--H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the carbon and hydrogen positions using the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal
(taken to align with $z$, with bilayer periodicity in the $xy$-plane).
Angular brackets denote average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
Python programs that use the MDAnalysis library \cite{agrawal11,gowers16}
used for all atom simulations is available in Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}
({\tt scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}). For united atom simulations, the trajectories
with hydrogens having ideal geometry were constructed first using either buildH program~\cite{buildH}
or ({\tt scratch/opAAUA\_prod.py}) in  Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}, and the order parameters were
then calculated from these trajectories. This approach has been tested against trajectories
with explicit hydrogens and the deviations in order parameters are small \cite{buildH,piggot18}.
The ion number density profiles were calculated using the {\tt gmx density} tool
of the Gromacs sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of POPE and POPG from $^{13}$C NMR}

The glycerol backbone and $\alpha$-carbon peaks in INEPT spectra of POPE were assigned based on
previously measured POPC spectra (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}) \cite{ferreira13}. The $\beta$-carbon peak was assigned based
on $^{13}$C chemical shift table for amines available at \url{https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/nmr/c13-data/cdata.htm}.
The order parameters for the glycerol backbone and headgroup C--H bonds were determined
from 2D-RPDLF and S-DROSS experiments (Fig. \ref{POPEspectra}), as described previously \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
The POPE experiments were recorded at 310~K, where the bilayer is in liquid disordered phase \cite{??}.
\todo{Details to be checked by Tiago}.

\todo{Figure and discussion about POPG experiments to be addded.}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of PE lipids are similar with 
different acyl chains and also close the values for POPC, althought PE gives systematically
slightly more positive values (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}). These could be explained with slightly larger temperature
in PE measurements, except for the $\alpha$-carbon with the positive sign, for which the
more positive value is farther away from zero. For PG lipids, the glycerol backbone order
parameters are more positive than for other lipids. The headgroup $\alpha$-carbon gives
value close to PE, while the value of $\beta$-carbon is distinct from other lipid being
only one which has positive sign, suggesting distinct conformation of PG lipids in this region.
This was not observed in previous $^2$H NMR study, where sign was not measured and $\beta$-carbon
order parameter was apparently similar to the value for PE and PC results.

In conclusion, the results suggests that the glycerol backbone conformations in all lipids are
relatively similar. Also, the headgroup conformations are similar for PC and PE lipids, while
PS and PG are singnificantly different. For PS lipids, the differences are discussed previously \cite{??}.

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone of POPE and POPG in MD simulations}
As reported previously for PC \cite{botan15} and PS \cite{NMRlipidsIVps} lipids,
the headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters show wide variation between different force fields
for both PE and PG lipids (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}),
and none of the force fields reproduce all values within experimental error bars.
%The Slipid simulations were able to capture the essential differences between PC and PS lipid
%headgroups \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}, but this is not the case for PE and PG lipids.
%\todo{Berger results are not here yet, but we should mention the ring like structures
%  pointed out by T. Piggot in the blog:
The poor performance of headgroup order parameters in Berger model can be probably explained by ring like structures seen in Fig. 6 in Ref. \citenum{mukhopadhyay04},
which is a typical feature for Berger based lipid force fields containing explicit hydrogen atoms in the head group \cite{zhao08,henin09,dahlberg10}.

Also in line with previous studies for PC \cite{botan15} and PS \cite{NMRlipidsIVps} lipids,
CHARMM36 simulations are in best agreement with experiments for headgroup and glycerol backbone
order parameters, and seem to capture all the essential differences between different headroups
(Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}).
%headgroup order parameters of PC PE, PG (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPE} and \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG}),
%as previously observed also for PS lipids \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
In previous study, CHARMM36 predicted the more negative $\beta$-carbon order parameter and larger forking of
the $\alpha$-carbon is PS headgroup than in PC \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
In this work, the CHARMM36 simulations reproduce also the other essential differences in experimental
headgroup order parameters between different headgroups (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}) despite the inaccuracies
in individual segments:
The PE headgroup order parameters in CHARMM36 simulations are similar to the PC \cite{botan15}
and $\beta$-carbon order parameters is positive in PG headgroup, in contrast to the negative values observed in
other lipids. Therefore, we use CHARMM36 simulations to analyze the structural differences between
headgroups (Fig.~\ref{structures}). While rotation around N-C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$-O$_\alpha$ dihedral was
significantly different in PS and PC headgroups in previous work \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}, essential differences
between PC, PE and PG are not observed here (Fig.~\ref{structures}) \todo{We need also the dihedral distributions to finish this discussion.}. \\

\end{figure*}
According to the electrometer concept, the PC headgroup order parameters increase
with the addition of negatively charged PG or PS lipids, but
are not affected by the addition of zwitterionic PE and SM lipids
or cholesterol (Fig.~\ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPG}) \cite{seelig87, scherer87,antila18}. 
The different responses of PC headgroup order parameters to PE and PG are roughly
reproduced in CHARMM36 simulations, although the changes are slightly
overestimated upon addition of PE and underestimated upon addition of PG (Fig.~\ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPG}).
Interestingly, the response of POPC headgroup order parameters to POPE is
close to experiments also in Berger-OPLS simulations, even though the response
of Berger force field to cholesterol was significantly overestimated in our previous work \cite{botan15}.
In all force fields except Slipids, the $\alpha$-carbon order parameters of different
hydrogens are responsing differently when mixed with PE or PG lipids \todo{Maybe we should figure out what is the reason for this}.
\todo{Maybe we should analyze the P-N vector angle from different simulations}.

For $\beta$-carbon order parameter in PG headgroup, experiments report
mild increase \cite{macdonald87} or no change~\cite{borle85} upon addition 
of PC lipids (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPGvsPCchange}). 
Simulations with all the tested force fields give only very small changes also for
the $\alpha$-carbon order parameter (Figs. \ref{HGorderparametersPGvsPC} and \ref{HGorderparametersPGvsPCchange}). 
Therefore, the simulations are generally in line with experimetns, suggesting that the
interactions with PC do not essentially effect the PG headgroup structure.
This is in contrast with previous results for PS headgroup \cite{antila18}, where
all the force fieds significantly overestimated the structural response of PS headgroup
to the interactions with PC lipids.

One can see that CHARMM 36 predicts a drop in the area on going from pure POPC to POPC/POPE 50:50. This means that POPC pack tightly to POPE. 
In contrast, the values for Berger are not that changed. 
The POPE value predicted by CHARMM 36 (in the mixture POPC/POPE 50:50) is much smaller than that predicted by Berger.\\
-------\\
The experimental acyl chain order parameters for POPE \cite{pare98} seem larger than reported for POPC \cite{ferreira13},
which supports the more condensed PE bilayer.
This is interesting, but to avoid the overexapansion of the manuscript, it is probably better to keep the focus in headgroups and ion binding also in this manuscript.}




\subsection{Sodium binding to PE and PG lipid bilayers}
In our previous study about PS lipids \cite{antila18}, the underestimated increase of PC
headgroup order parameters upon addition of negaticely charged lipids
was related
to the overestimated counterion binding affinity, which would overcompensates the effect of negative charge.
Similar correlation is observed here in %other than GROMOS-CKP simulation:
Lipid 17 simulations, which exhibits stronger counter-ion binding affinity to pure POPG bilayer (Fig. \ref{CIdensPG})
and larger decrease in POPC $\beta$ carbon order parameter upon addition of POPG than other simulations.
Together with the lower area per molecule (59.5 {\AA}$^2$) than in experiments (66.1 {\AA}$^2$),
the results suggest that the counterions bind too strongly and shield the electrostatic repulsion between PG headgroups
in bilayers simulated with Lipid17 parameters.
In GROMOS-CKP simulations, however, the $\beta$-carbon order parameter of POPC
increases upon addition of POPG more than in CHARMM36 and Slipids simulations even though the binding affinities in these
simulations are similar. On the other hand, the responses of different hydrogens attached in $\alpha$-carbons
are different in all simulations except in Slipids, most sever in Lipid17 and GROMOS-CKP where other in increases
and other decreases \todo{Can we figure out the reason for this?}.
In conclusion, the counter-ion binding seems to be overestimated in Lipid17 with the strongest affinity among the
tested models, while with this data we cannot fully evaluate binding affinity in the other models.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/CIdensPG.eps}
  \caption{\label{CIdensPG}
    Counterion densities and area per lipids from simulations with PG lipids.

  }
\end{figure}

%Sodium binding to PC lipid bilayers is significantly overestimated by most simulations models \cite{catte16}.
%Also, sodium binding to PS lipids seems to be overestimated, although the
%presence of counterions complicate the comparison for negatively charged lipids \cite{NMRlipidsIVps}.
Similarly to POPG, the Lipid17 exhibits stronger sodium binding affinity
to POPE bilayers than Slipids, CHARMM36 and GROMOS-CKP (Fig. \ref{NAdensPE}).
In Lipid17 the sodium binding affinity to POPE is approximately similar as to POPC,
while in other models exhibit weaker binding to POPE (Fig. \ref{NAdensPC}).
The difference is small in Slipids and CHARMM36, while GROMOS-CKP predicts
subtantially stronger binding to POPC.
Experimental data for sodium binding to PE lipids is not available, while
simulations in agreement with electrometer data from NMR suggests that
sodium binding to POPC is weaker than in any of the simulations
here (Fig. \ref{NAdensPC})~\cite{catte16,melcr18}. Assuming that the binding
to POPE would be similar than to POPC, the sodium binding affinity to POPE
is potentially realistic in CHARMM36, Slipids, and GROMOS-CKP simulations here,
but substantially overestimated in Lipid17 simulation.
%On the other hand, the sodium binding affinity is stronger to POPE in Lipid17 simulations than to POPC in simulations with
%previous Amber lipid version, Lipid14.
\todo{The potential differences in the used ion models should be checked}.

\subsection{Cation binding to PE and PG lipid bilayers}
The headgroup order parameters of PC lipids can used to measure ion binding
affinity to lipid bilayers, because their magnitude is linearly proportional
to the amount of bound charge in bilayer according to the molecular
electrometer concept \cite{seelig87,catte16}. The molecular electrometer concept
can be used also for bilayers containing PC lipids mixed with charged
lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90,NMRlipidsIVps}.
%This is demonstrated in Figs \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
%\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M},
%showing order parameters for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
%as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration in the presence of different amounts of
%negatively charged PS or PG lipids.
%
%PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
%PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
%as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
%(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%Further, the order parameters decrease with the addition
%of CaCl$_2$ and the decrease is more pronounced for systems with more
%negatively charged lipids (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%At CaCl$_2$ concentrations ($\sim$ 50-300mM) where order parameters reach the values for pure PC,
%the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
%overcharging occurs above these concenterations.
Based on the electrometer concept and other data is has been suggested that \cite{seelig90}
\begin{displayquote}
  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
\end{displayquote}
The electrometer concept has been very useful in evaluating ion binding affinity in simulations
against experiments, because the headgroup order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration
can be directly compared with experiments \cite{catte16,melcr18,NMRlipidsIVps}.

Calcium binding affinity to PC and PS lipid bilayers was not correctly described by
any of the standard MD simulation forced fields \cite{catte16,NMRlipidsIVps}, while
recently introduced force field with electronic continuum correction (ECC) performed better \cite{melcr18}.
The decrease of $\alpha$-carbon order parameter of PC lipids in PC:PG mixtures as a function
of calcium concentration is close to experiments CHARMM36 simulations (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG}),
but the decrease of $\beta$-carbon order parameter seems to be overestimated.
However, the $\beta$-carbon order parameter was not actually measured from these samples,
but they are calculated from empirical relation $\Delta S_{\beta}=0.43\Delta S_{\alpha}$ \cite{akutsu81}.
The result is similar to the $\sim$200~ns simulations with PC lipids in previous work \cite{catte16}.
However, when simulation was continued for $\mu$s, the binding affinity substantially increased
and interpretation was that calcium overbinds to PC lipid in CHARMM36. Therefore, the
conclusion seems to be similar here, although the new NBfix parameters may complicate
the situation \todo{The status of NBfix parameters in these simulations should be checked.}.
%Anyway, the data presented in NMRlipids II project and in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} together
%suggest that Calcium binding is similarly overestimated by CHARMM36 model in pure POPC bilayers and mixtures with
%POPG. The good agreement of $\alpha$ carbon would be explained by too weak dependence of its order
%parameter of bound charge
%\todo{The response of CHARMM36 to cationic surfactant against experiments \cite{scherer89} to be checked.
%  I have already ran the simulations, analysis to be done.}.

The $\beta$-carbon order parameter of PG exhibits a rapid decrease with small CaCl$_2$ concentrations
and a more modest decrease with larger concentrations in experiments \cite{borle85} (Fig. \ref{PSPGchangesWITHCaCl}).
The rapid decrease with CaCl$_2$ is observed but overestimated in CHARMM36 simulation
with POPC:POPG 1:1 mixture, but not in 4:1 mixture \todo{This is little bit weird, should be checked.}.

%\section{Measurements of order parameter sign}

%Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNS} summarizes the experimental results on the order parameter sign
%measurement for POPS sample. The experimental protocol is the same used in Ref. \citenum{ferreira16}.
%In (a) you see the headgroup region of the INEPT spectrum where alpha and beta are
%identified. In (b) you have the R-PDLF slices for alpha and beta where you see one single
%splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
%of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot be
%calculated. On the bottom you have the S-DROSS slices of these two carbons. The grey lines show a
%random collection of slices from noise such that it gets clear what is significant. The S-DROSS
%slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative. The slice for alpha shows that
%the higher order parameter is positive and suggests that the smaller order parameter is negative
%(from the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times).

%The results updated with SIMPSON simulations for the SDROSS profiles
%are shown in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson}. The value for the smaller
%alpha order parameter is taken from Fig 3 in Ref. \citenum{roux91},

%numerical value for this. The plots in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} (c) show
%the following. The error bars and points are the experimental SDROSS data.

%the order parameter for beta equal to -0.12 and for alpha one order parameter
%equal to 0.09 and the other equal to -0.02 (black) or 0.02 (grey).
%Since the black lines agree with experimental data, we conlude that

%order parameters are 0.09 and -0.02.
